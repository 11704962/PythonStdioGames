# PythonStdioGames
A compilation of text-based games written in Python that only use "standard i/o".



TODO NOTES:
Games should:
* Be under 256 lines long.
* Use only the standard library (or perhaps Colorama or PyTextCanvas)
* Only use print() and input() stdio text for input/output. (No graphics or mouse input.)
* Be well-commented.
* Have comments pointing out what lines can be changed.
* Have comments explaining their data structures.
* Have links to pythontutor.net to view run throughs.
